  "description":"Primarily autograph letters signed, dating from 1557-1671, especially of Richard Bagot and of his son Walter. They are letters to them, letters from them (some of them drafts written on blank parts of letters addressed to them) and copies made by them of letters addressed to others, especially of official letters. The letters cover a wide range of topics and amply illustrate the life of a prosperous county family the multifarious duties it members were called upon to perform for the Crown. Also included are documents, dating from 1428-1662, concerning recusants, a form of the oath of supremacy (L.a.1044), a few deeds, specifications for two buildings (L.a.1070) and other papers.",

  "text":"L.a.1 Letter from Humphrey Adderley, Lincoln's Inn, to Walter Bagot, 1620 May 24 Thanks for curing his daughter Mary's eye; fears she has long been a burden. Has long endured a prisoner's life but trusts to be enlarged soon; has worked out his own peace and quiet, but the smart his children bear tears his heart asunder. Is sending a keg of sturgeon. L.a.2 Letter from Ralph Adderley I to Sir Nicholas Bagnal, marshal (of army) in Ireland, 1567 April 10 Asks him to watch over John Bagot, Richard's brother, who is going to Ireland to sow his wild oats, that he may not fall into any penury. His brother is a sober gentleman, as highly thought of as any esquire not exceeding 300 marks land within three shires.
